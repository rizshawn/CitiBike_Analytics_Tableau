# Tableau Citi Bike Analytics

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

Ridership data from January to July 2019 was aggregated, analyzed. Tableau was utilized to create visualizations, interactive maps, and dashboards to communicate the findings. 

Please refer to the following folders and files for project data:
- Images folder for Tableau visualizations
